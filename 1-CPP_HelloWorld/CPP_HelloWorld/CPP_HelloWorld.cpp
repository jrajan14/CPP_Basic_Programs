#include <iostream>

using namespace std; 
//This will be used throughout the project.
//You do not need to use this in several cases, 
//using std::<keyword> in visual studio is a good practice

int main()
{
    //std::cout << "Hello World!\n";   //IF YOU DON'T WRITE "using namespace std", you need to use this line of code.

    cout << "Hello World";          //Simple "cout" statement

    //return 0; is needed because the main function returns 'int'.
    //I didn't use it because here in visual studio, the 'main' function is an exception and returns 0 implicitly.
